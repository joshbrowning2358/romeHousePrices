#proposed list of figures for report
# consider two reports? One rental, one vendita?

#area = cap,zona,quartiere whichever we consider most interesting

1. Bar chart by area showing average price per square meter. We should try to restrict the data included in this graph to the 5-10 most important zone/quartiere. We could just this by the # of  units on sales in different areas.

2. Graphs showing number of units for sale/rent in various areas. 

3. Heat map, but more zoomed in than current version. Also, I made the scale scale larger to and adjust the gradient a bit to highlight the difference more. I also assume white is the average? We'll need to make this known somehow. I would also do a version with sale prices.
